# snippet-repo
just a few snippets that I, and maybe you, find useful.

Please correct me if I am wrong on any of this!

## Files
The ```snippet-template.snippet``` file is a template for you to create your own snippets.

## How to import these into Visual Studio:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Go into Tools > Code Snippets Manager (or press Ctrl + K, Ctrl + B).
3. Select the appropriate language.
3. Click 'Import'
4. Select the snippet you want to import
5. Select one or more locations for your snippet
6. Now you can code faster using your new custom snippets!

## How to edit the snippets:
- The code goes between the square brackets after ```!CDATA```.
- Multiline code is supported, but indents may change depending on your code editor's settings.
- The shortcut for the snippet goes in the ```<Shortcut>``` section.
- You'll have to import a snippet again after editing.
- Make sure you enter the correct language name!
- Use the file extension ```.snippet``` even though the language used is XML.
